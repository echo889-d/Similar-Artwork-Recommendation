# Similar-Artwork-Recommendation
Using a publicly available database of artwork from multiple regions, we aim to build a web application that, given a user uploaded image, returns similar artwork

The approach comes down to 4 questions:
1) How to compare similarity between images? 
2) How to evaluate the performance? 
3) What method has the lowest testing error? 
4) What method is most computationally efficient?
